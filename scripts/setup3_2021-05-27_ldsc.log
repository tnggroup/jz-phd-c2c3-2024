Please note that the results initially printed to the screen and log file reflect the NON-liability h2 and cov_g. However, a liability conversion is being used for trait /Users/jakz/Documents/local_db/JZ_GED_PHD_ADMIN_GENERAL/data/gwas_sumstats/munged_1kg_eur_supermunge/ADHD05.gz when creating the genetic covariance matrix used as input for Genomic SEM and liability scale results are printed at the end of the log file.

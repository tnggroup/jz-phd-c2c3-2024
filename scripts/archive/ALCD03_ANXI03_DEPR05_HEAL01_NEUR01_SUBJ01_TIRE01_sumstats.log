Interpreting the P column as the P column.
Interpreting the N column as the N (sample size) column.
Interpreting the  NCAS  column as the N_CAS (sample size for cases) column.
Interpreting the  NCON  column as the N_CON (sample size for controls) column.
As the file includes both N_CAS and N_CON columns, the summation of these two columns will be used as the total sample size
As the summary statistics file includes a sample size column, this is being used in place of the user provided sample size. If the user wishes to still use the provided sample size, as opposed to the sample size listed in the summary statistics file, please change the sample size column header to N2.However, we note that sample size is only used for LPM and OLS conversions.

3095 rows were removed from the /Users/jakz/Documents/local_db/JZ_GED_PHD_ADMIN_GENERAL/data/gwas_sumstats/cleaned/ALCD03.gz summary statistics file due to effect values estimated at exactly 0 as this causes problems for matrix inversion necessary for later Genomic SEM analyses.
18569 row(s) were removed from the /Users/jakz/Documents/local_db/JZ_GED_PHD_ADMIN_GENERAL/data/gwas_sumstats/cleaned/ALCD03.gz summary statistics file due to the effect allele (A1) column not matching A1 or A2 in the reference file.
